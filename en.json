    "description": "Hi! If you're looking for a motivated junior developer who is self-taught and has 2+ years of experience, you're in the right place. I acquired my knowledge through a structured, project-based learning path where I mastered every skill through real tasks.<br><br>On the Scrimba Front-End Developer career path, I've completed 50+ hours of interactive training videos, 80+ coding exercises, and numerous real projects so far. This isn't just theoretical knowledge, but practical experience – from blackjack games to complex JavaScript applications. I started learning React in 2025, which represents a new professional challenge.<br><br>What makes my approach special is that I learn every technology in small steps, through projects. I don't just know how to use CSS Grid – I also know when and why it's worth applying. The same goes for JavaScript or responsive design. I have basic knowledge in Laravel, which helps me understand frontend-backend communication.<br><br>As a junior developer, I approach every project with fresh perspective, high motivation, and continuous learning drive. If you're looking for a developer who knows the answer to the 'why' question and creates value with every line of code, let's talk!",
