    "description": "Hi! I'm glad you're here. As a frontend developer, I help turn your ideas into real, well-functioning, and visually clean websites – whether you're an individual entrepreneur or representing a newly emerging brand.<br><br>In my work, I place great emphasis on responsiveness, fast loading, and ensuring that the site provides a convincing experience on every screen size. Whether it's a portfolio page, service overview, or creative landing page, it's important to me that the end result reflects the client's personality and goals.<br><br>I'm well-versed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages, work with Bootstrap and Laravel frameworks, and continuously expand my knowledge. I've already created several websites on commission, and I also develop through personal projects – because I believe that learning never stops.<br><br>I adapt flexibly to needs and always strive to make collaboration smooth, trust-based, and successful. If you want a website that not only looks good but also works efficiently, you're in the right place.<br><br>Check out my work, and if you like what you see, feel free to contact me! Let's discuss what you need and build something that really works – and is tailored to you.",

    "description": "Hi! If you're looking for a developer who doesn't just code but creates real value, you're in the right place. I acquired my knowledge through a structured, project-based learning path where I mastered every skill through real tasks.<br><br>On the Scrimba Front-End Developer career path, I completed 70+ hours of interactive training videos, 100+ coding exercises, and dozens of real projects. This wasn't just theoretical knowledge, but practical experience – from blackjack games to React applications.<br><br>What makes my approach special is that I learned every technology in small steps, through projects. I don't just know how to use CSS Grid – I also know when and why it's worth applying. The same goes for JavaScript, React, or responsive design.<br><br>If you're looking for a developer who knows the answer to the 'why' question and creates value with every line of code, let's talk!",
